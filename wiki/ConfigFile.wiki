==Alerts==

{{{alert[/thresh]: expression}}}

or

{{{!name[/thresh]: expression}}}

Theshold is options and defaults to 1.  It's the number of consecutive times the expression must be nonzero to be considered an "alert".

Alert expressions are "Safe" container PERL expressions, and can take advantage of arithmetic logic.  IE:  $load_one > $cpu_num*2.

If an alert has no name, the expression itself is used in the report.

Everything's processed in-order.  Alerts with the same name override others.

Host-specific alerts can be set up with:
{{host: name}} 

Any alerts following that section are host-specific.  Hosts probably should be globs... but right now they are literal strings that must match the beginning of the hostname.  In the future, expressions that contain a '*' will be treated as a "glob" match.
